HI
hello.

And I would Like to say 
that can the layout be some more fancy or something?

sure.

The rectanglar box could replace by some background color
and the corner could be round or something

and the on/off may be present by some gif
something like that? more presentable

so I continue for the 3rd Json
again, no "null" should be seen
the the time is not such user readable format

then, skip CarPlate. I don't need that field

then, the "Name" should have something in Json

for the name field, please use "entranceName"

got it so far?

sure.

send these notes to me after,.ok

The returned Json in SignalR will not have paging info. 

would that be some problem?

no.
I show you the sample signalR Json

This is the sample Json return, by default, it is order by time desc

and return 15 record currently

do you need the paging info?

no.
great
then Just go head
I will deploy it in to sit enviroment

and the signalR program?
No need. I will deploy to SIT
car-park-api-sit.xanvi.com

I see.
so the project problem is all?

yes. any problem?

I have some proglems after a while.
You can login to skype and I will let you know in skype if I am not in freelancer, so 
please avaliable in skype from now.

Do you know how to trigger the event?

signalR program>
yes. Maybe I make some link for you to trigger the event.

For the car space, you can click into the car space and change the status to Occupied/Free

While for the other 2 Json, it might need additional link for you to trigger the signalR Json

Let me know please.
